# âœ… DJ Controls Fix Complete

**Issue Fixed:** DJ Controls button in Floating Action Menu was not opening the DJControlView.

---

## ðŸ“‹ What Was Fixed

### **1. Updated FloatingActionMenu.swift**
- Added `@Binding var showDJControls: Bool` parameter
- Updated DJ Controls button action to set `showDJControls = true`

### **2. Updated BranchrAppRoot.swift**
- Added `@State private var showDJControls = false`
- Added service instances: `musicSync` and `songRequests`
- Added lazy `hostDJ` computed property
- Added `.sheet(isPresented: $showDJControls)` modifier with DJControlView
- Passed binding to FloatingActionMenu

---

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works Now

### **User Flow:**
1. Tap floating action button (âš¡) â†’ Menu expands
2. Tap "DJ Controls" â†’ `showDJControls = true`
3. Sheet presents â†’ DJControlView with full controls
4. User can manage song requests, playback, and DJ features

### **Code Flow:**
```swift
FloatingActionMenu
  â†’ Tap "DJ Controls" button
  â†’ Action sets showDJControls = true
  â†’ BranchrAppRoot detects binding change
  â†’ .sheet modifier presents DJControlView
  â†’ DJControlView receives dependencies (hostDJ, musicSync, songRequests)
```
