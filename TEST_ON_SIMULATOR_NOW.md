## 🧪 What to Test

### **Test DJ Controls:**

1. **Open DJ Controls**
   - On Home screen, tap "DJ Controls" button
   - Sheet slides up from bottom

2. **Add Test Music (Optional)**
   - Open Music app on simulator
   - Add a few songs to library (if you want)

3. **Try Play Button**
   - DJ Controls → Tap "Play Music"
   - Should see "Playing..." or song name

---

## 🔍 Expected Results

### **✅ Should Work:**
- App launches without crash
- DJ Controls sheet appears
- Music authorization prompts (if first time)
- Play button responds
- No provisioning errors (simulator doesn't need them!)

### **⚠️ Potential:**
- Music won't actually play until you:
  - Add songs to Music.app library first, OR
  - Enable MusicKit in developer portal for real device

## 🚫 Why Simulator Works But Device Doesn't

**Simulator:**
- ✅ No provisioning profile needed
- ✅ No MusicKit entitlement check
- ✅ Just needs code to compile

**Device:**
- ⚠️ Needs provisioning profile
- ⚠️ MusicKit must be enabled on Apple's servers
- ⚠️ Requires App ID sync

---

## 🎯 Next Steps After Testing

### **Option A: Keep Testing on Simulator**
- Perfect for UI/UX testing
- Music functionality limited

### **Option B: Enable MusicKit for Device**
1. Go to https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list/bundleId
2. Find `com.joedormond.branchr`
3. Enable MusicKit checkbox
4. Wait 10 minutes
5. Build for device

---

## 📋 Summary

**Right Now:**
- ✅ Build for simulator = WORKS
- ⚠️ Build for device = Needs MusicKit enabled in portal

**Your Code:**
- ✅ Perfect!
- ✅ All entitlements correct
- ✅ Ready to test

**Just use the simulator for now!** Then fix provisioning when you need device testing. 🎯
