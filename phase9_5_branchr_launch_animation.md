# üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Branchr Phase 9.5 ‚Äì Animated Launch Screen (Cyclists Riding Across Screen)

**Objective:**  
Create a dynamic **launch animation** where **3 bike riders** ride across the screen horizontally ‚Äî resembling a bicycle traffic sign but in motion.  
The animation plays for about **3 seconds**, then transitions automatically into the app's **HomeView**.

---

## üß† Technical Goals
1. ‚úÖ Replace the static Launch Screen with a **custom animated splash view**.
2. ‚úÖ Animate 3 cyclist icons moving left ‚Üí right in sequence.
3. ‚úÖ Match the style of a **traffic sign** (minimalist silhouettes on a yellow background).
4. ‚úÖ Keep total duration ~3 seconds before navigating to HomeView.
5. ‚úÖ Comply with Apple's launch screen performance rules (fast startup, no delay logic in LaunchScreen.storyboard ‚Äî use a transition view after launch).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Cursor Prompt Instructions

> Extend the **Branchr** SwiftUI app (iOS 18.2, Xcode 16.2) to include a professional animated splash screen before loading the HomeView.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **LaunchAnimationView.swift**
- A SwiftUI view with a solid **yellow background** (traffic-sign color: `Color(red: 1.0, green: 0.86, blue: 0.2)`).
- Displays 3 `LaunchBikeRiderView` icons spaced evenly across the screen.
- Each rider animates from **left to right**, slightly staggered:
  ```swift
  withAnimation(.easeInOut(duration: 2.5).delay(0.2 * index))
```
‚Ä¢    Optional wheel rotation animation (use small rotation effect).
    ‚Ä¢    After 3 seconds ‚Üí fades into HomeView using .transition(.opacity).

2Ô∏è‚É£ LaunchBikeRiderView.swift
    ‚Ä¢    Each rider is an Image or SF Symbol ("bicycle.circle.fill" or custom asset).
    ‚Ä¢    Black silhouette style to mimic traffic sign.
    ‚Ä¢    Optional gradient glow for depth (Liquid Glass consistency).

3Ô∏è‚É£ StryVrApp.swift (or BranchrApp.swift)
    ‚Ä¢    Set initial screen as LaunchAnimationView().
    ‚Ä¢    Auto-navigate to HomeView() after animation ends:

@State private var showHome = false

After 3 seconds:

withAnimation { showHome = true }

4Ô∏è‚É£ LaunchScreen.storyboard
    ‚Ä¢    Keep a static yellow background with centered Branchr text (no logic here).
This satisfies iOS launch compliance ‚Äî the animated SwiftUI view runs right after app launch.

‚∏ª

üé® Design Guidelines
    ‚Ä¢    Background color: #FFD83B (traffic sign yellow)
    ‚Ä¢    Rider silhouettes: black
    ‚Ä¢    Animation timing: ~2.8‚Äì3.0 seconds
    ‚Ä¢    Use .easeInOut for natural pacing
    ‚Ä¢    At the end, fade smoothly into HomeView

‚∏ª

üß™ Test Checklist
    1.    Build and run app.
    2.    Launch screen appears instantly (static yellow ‚Üí animated cyclists).
    3.    Three cyclists move smoothly across the screen.
    4.    After ~3 seconds, fade into HomeView.
    5.    No lag, crash, or black screen.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Success Criteria
    ‚Ä¢    Instant launch (no artificial delay in LaunchScreen.storyboard).
    ‚Ä¢    Smooth animation at 60 fps.
    ‚Ä¢    Transitions automatically to HomeView after 3 seconds.
    ‚Ä¢    Visual theme matches Branchr's Liquid Glass and minimalist brand.
