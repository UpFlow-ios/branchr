# üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Branchr Phase 6.5 ‚Äì Auto-Detect Ride & Tracking Prompt

**Objective:**  
Enable Branchr to automatically detect when a user starts a ride (bike, run, jog) and gently prompt:
> "It looks like you're riding. Would you like to start tracking this session?"

If the user taps **Yes**, GPS tracking begins.  
If the user taps **No**, tracking is skipped and motion detection continues passively.

---

## üß† Technical Goals
1. ‚úÖ Implement motion-type detection using **CoreMotion** (`CMMotionActivityManager`).  
2. ‚úÖ Automatically prompt the user when biking or running motion is detected.  
3. ‚úÖ Allow quick "Yes / No" response directly in-app.  
4. ‚úÖ Integrate with `LocationTrackingService` from Phase 6.  
5. ‚úÖ Maintain battery efficiency (no heavy polling).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Cursor Prompt Instructions

> You are extending the **Branchr** iOS SwiftUI app (Swift 5.9+, iOS 18.2, Xcode 16.2).  
> Add automatic ride detection and prompt logic.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ `MotionDetectionService.swift`
- Uses `CMMotionActivityManager` to detect motion types:
  - `.cycling`, `.running`, `.walking`
- Observe updates continuously (every few seconds).
- When `.cycling` or `.running` state becomes `true`, trigger a Combine publisher:
  ```swift
  @Published var rideDetected: Bool
  ```

‚Ä¢ Include properties:

```swift
private let motionManager = CMMotionActivityManager()
private let queue = OperationQueue()
```

‚Ä¢ Functions:

```swift
func startMonitoring()
func stopMonitoring()
```

‚Ä¢ Optional: debounce detection (don't re-prompt if user declined recently).

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ `RidePromptView.swift`
‚Ä¢ Simple alert-style overlay (SwiftUI Alert or custom frosted card):

```
üö¥‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Looks like you're on a ride!
Would you like to start tracking this session?
[Start Tracking]   [No Thanks]
```

‚Ä¢ When the user taps Start Tracking, call:

```swift
locationTrackingService.startTracking()
```

‚Ä¢ If No Thanks, set a cooldown flag (e.g., 10 min) before prompting again.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ `RideMapView.swift` (Update)
‚Ä¢ Add `.onReceive(motionDetectionService.$rideDetected)` ‚Üí show RidePromptView automatically.
‚Ä¢ If user accepts ‚Üí transition to tracking state and show map overlay.

## üîê Info.plist Additions

```xml
<key>NSMotionUsageDescription</key>
<string>Branchr uses motion data to detect when you begin a ride and ask if you'd like to track it.</string>
```

## üß© Integration Logic
‚Ä¢ `MotionDetectionService` runs quietly in the background (or when app is active).
‚Ä¢ It does not start GPS automatically ‚Äî it only triggers the prompt.
‚Ä¢ Once the user approves, `LocationTrackingService.startTracking()` is called.
‚Ä¢ Tracking continues normally until stopped manually.
‚Ä¢ Motion detection pauses while tracking to save power, resumes after ride ends.

---

## üß™ Test Checklist
1. Launch app ‚Üí wait a few seconds while moving (or simulate via Xcode Motion).
2. Shake or move phone ‚Üí triggers `.cycling` or `.running` state.
3. Prompt appears:

```
It looks like you're on a ride!
Would you like to start tracking this session?
```

4. Tap Yes ‚Üí starts ride tracking automatically.
5. Tap No ‚Üí no tracking; prompt reappears only after cooldown period.

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria
‚Ä¢ Motion detection works reliably for cycling / jogging.
‚Ä¢ Prompt triggers only once per detected session.
‚Ä¢ GPS tracking starts only after explicit user consent.
‚Ä¢ Low battery impact (no constant location polling).
‚Ä¢ 0 build errors / warnings.

Save as:
~/Documents/branchr/phase6_5_branchr_autotrack_prompt.md

Then in Cursor, type:

"Generate all code for Phase 6.5 ‚Äì Auto-Detect Ride & Tracking Prompt."
