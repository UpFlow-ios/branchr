## 🔧 Changes Applied

### 1. MusicService.swift - Real Playback Implementation

**File:** `Services/MusicService.swift`

#### New Method: `playSampleSong()`
```swift
func playSampleSong() async {
    guard isAuthorized else {
        print("⚠️ Not authorized. Please connect Apple Music first.")
        return
    }
    
    do {
        // Search Apple Music catalog
        var request = MusicCatalogSearchRequest(term: "Calvin Harris", types: [Song.self])
        request.limit = 5
        let response = try await request.response()
        
        guard let song = response.songs.first else {
            print("⚠️ No songs found in search.")
            return
        }
        
        // Set up queue and play
        player.queue = ApplicationMusicPlayer.Queue(for: [song])
        try await player.play()
        
        // Update UI state
        isPlaying = true
        currentSongTitle = song.title
        currentArtist = song.artistName
        artworkURL = song.artwork?.url(width: 300, height: 300)
        
        print("🎶 Now playing: \(song.title) by \(song.artistName)")
    } catch {
        print("❌ Playback error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
    }
}
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Real catalog search
- ✅ Searches for "Calvin Harris"
- ✅ Gets first matching song
- ✅ Creates playback queue

### 2. DJControlSheetView.swift - Smart Play Button

**File:** `Views/DJ/DJControlSheetView.swift`

#### Updated Play/Pause Logic:
```swift
Button(action: {
    if musicService.isPlaying {
        musicService.pause()
    } else {
        // Smart logic: search if no song, resume if paused
        if musicService.currentSongTitle == "No song playing" {
            Task { await musicService.playSampleSong() }
        } else {
            Task { await musicService.resume() }
        }
    }
}) {
    Image(systemName: musicService.isPlaying ? "pause.fill" : "play.fill")
        // ... styling
}
```

**Behavior:**
- 🎵 **No song loaded:** Searches and plays Calvin Harris
- ⏸️ **Song paused:** Resumes playback
- ⏯️ **Song playing:** Pauses playback
