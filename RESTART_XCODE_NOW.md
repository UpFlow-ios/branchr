# âœ… Xcode Force Quit - Now Reopen Cleanly

## ðŸŽ‰ What I Just Did

âœ… **Force quit Xcode** (killed stuck process)  
âœ… **Cleared DerivedData** (removed corrupt cache)

---

## ðŸš€ Now Do This:

### **1. Reopen Xcode**

- Open your project: `branchr.xcodeproj`

### **2. Wait for Xcode to Load**

- It will rebuild its cache (30-60 seconds)
- First time might take a bit longer

### **3. Go to Signing & Capabilities**

- Select your project in left sidebar
- Select **"branchr"** target
- Click **"Signing & Capabilities"** tab

### **4. Click "Try Again" or "Download Profile"**

- If you see any signing errors
- Click the refresh button
- Or manually click "Try Again"

### **5. Build for Device**

- Select your iPhone from device menu
- Press **Cmd + R**
- Should work now! âœ…

## ðŸŽ¯ What Was Wrong

**Xcode was stuck downloading/updating the provisioning profile** since 3 AM!

**Why:**
- Corrupt DerivedData cache
- Stuck signing update process
- Network timeout

**Fix:**
- Force quit + clear cache
- Start fresh

## ðŸ“‹ If You Still See Errors

**Make sure you downloaded the profile:**
1. Go to that Apple Developer Portal page
2. Click **"Download"** button
3. Double-click the `.mobileprovision` file
4. Try building again

## ðŸŽ‰ Summary

**Xcode restarted cleanly**  
**Cache is cleared**  
**Ready to build!**

Open Xcode and try building for device now! ðŸš€
