# Phase 76: HomeView Liquid Glass Fix + Apple Music Artwork Sync

**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Date:** December 2025  
**Build:** ✅ BUILD SUCCEEDED

---

## 🎯 Objectives

Fix HomeView UI regressions and polish the liquid glass design while preserving all existing app logic. Focus on artwork persistence, button behavior, and layout consistency.

---

## 📋 What Was Implemented

### 1. ✅ Live Blurred Artwork Background (Fixed)

**Problem:**
- Background often showed plain gradient instead of blurred album art
- Background disappeared when navigating away and back
- Didn't update when songs changed

**Solution:**
- Added `@Published private(set) var lastArtworkImage: UIImage?` to `MusicService`
- Cached artwork persists between track changes (never goes to `nil` during transitions)
- `HomeView` now uses `musicService.lastArtworkImage` for stable background
- Full-screen blurred artwork with 30pt radius + dark gradient overlay
- Automatic fallback to clean gradient when no music is playing

**Files Modified:**
- `Services/MusicService.swift` - Added cached artwork property
- `Views/Home/HomeView.swift` - Background now uses cached artwork

---

### 2. ✅ Center Album Card Stability (Fixed)

**Problem:**
- Album artwork + play buttons flickered and disappeared
- Only appeared "every now and then" during song changes
- Buttons hidden when `nowPlaying` was temporarily `nil`

**Solution:**
- Album card always visible when `preferredMusicSource == .appleMusicSynced`
- Uses `musicService.lastArtworkImage` (cached) for artwork display
- Play/Pause, Previous, Next buttons always present in Apple Music mode
- Fallback to "Apple Music Ready" placeholder when no artwork cached yet
- Track title/artist conditional but controls remain stable

**Files Modified:**
- `Views/Home/RideControlPanelView.swift` - Stabilized card logic

---

### 3. ✅ Weekly Goal Card Shortened

**Problem:**
- Card felt too tall and took up excessive space
- Large numbers and extra spacing made it visually heavy

**Solution:**
- Reduced vertical padding: `18pt` → `12pt`
- Simplified title font: `.headline` → `.subheadline`
- Shrunk progress bar: `10pt` height → `8pt` height
- Condensed info row into single line:
  - `0.0 / 15 mi    This week: 0.0 mi    🔥 Streak: 0  ·  Best: 3 days`
- Removed large progress numbers display
- Maintained rainbow gradient progress bar
- Kept all underlying data logic intact

**Files Modified:**
- `Views/Home/WeeklyGoalCardView.swift` - Compact design

**Note:** No "ride mode selector" was found in the card (already removed in previous phase)

---

### 4. ✅ Button Rounding & Rainbow Halo Fixed

**Problem:**
- Buttons looked square instead of rounded
- Rainbow halo not "staying on when pushed" for active features
- Halo only showed during press, not while feature active

**Solution:**
- All buttons use consistent **20pt corner radius** with `.continuous` style
- Added `isActive: Bool` parameter to `GlassGridButton`
- Rainbow halo now shows when:
  - **Ride button**: `rideSession.rideState == .active || .paused`
  - **Connection button**: `connectionManager.state == .connected`
  - **Voice Chat button**: `voiceService.isVoiceChatActive`
  - **SOS button**: `isSOSArmed == true`
- Halo persists while feature is active (not just during press)
- All buttons use `.ultraThinMaterial` for authentic liquid glass

**Files Modified:**
- `Views/Home/HomeView.swift` - Updated `GlassGridButton` with `isActive` parameter

---

### 5. ✅ Artwork Persistence During Navigation

**Solution:**
- Cached artwork in `MusicService.lastArtworkImage` never clears
- Only updates when new non-nil artwork is received
- Background and album card both use cached artwork
- No `onDisappear` clearing of artwork
- `HomeView` uses `@ObservedObject` for reactive updates

**Result:** Artwork remains stable when navigating to/from `RideTrackingView`

---

### 6. ✅ Portrait-Only Mode Locked (iPhone)

**Solution:**
- Added to `branchr/Info.plist`:
```xml
<key>UISupportedInterfaceOrientations</key>
<array>
    <string>UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait</string>
</array>
```

**Result:** App only supports portrait orientation on iPhone

---

### 7. ✅ Native SwiftUI Materials Verified

**Confirmed Usage:**
- **All glass surfaces** use `.ultraThinMaterial` (no custom blur components)
- **All buttons** use `RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 20, style: .continuous)`
- **Consistent corner radius**: 20pt throughout HomeView
- **Drop shadows** for depth: `radius: 12, y: 8` on buttons
- **Rainbow halo** uses existing `RainbowGlowModifier.swift`

**Result:** Future-proof design that auto-updates with Apple's material system

   - Album card always visible in Apple Music mode
   - Uses cached artwork for stability
   - Play buttons always present

4. ✅ `Views/Home/WeeklyGoalCardView.swift`

## 🎨 Visual Improvements

### Before Phase 76:
- ❌ Flickering album artwork
- ❌ Disappearing background
- ❌ Square-looking buttons
- ❌ Rainbow halo only on press
- ❌ Tall weekly goal card
- ❌ Landscape rotation allowed

### After Phase 76:
- ✅ Stable, persistent artwork

## 🧪 Validation Results

- ✅ **Build Status:** BUILD SUCCEEDED
- ✅ **Background Artwork:** Persists during navigation
- ✅ **Album Card:** No flicker, always visible
- ✅ **Playback Controls:** Stable and functional
- ✅ **Button Rounding:** Consistent 20pt corners
- ✅ **Rainbow Halo:** Active states working correctly
- ✅ **Weekly Goal:** Compact and clean
- ✅ **Portrait Lock:** Rotation disabled

---

## 🔄 Known Limitations

None. All objectives met successfully.

---

## 📝 Follow-Up Ideas

1. Add subtle fade animation when artwork changes
2. Consider caching multiple recent artworks for smoother transitions
3. Potential `onReceive` subscription for real-time MPNowPlayingInfoCenter changes
4. Explore adding album artwork to ride tracking screen

---

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

This phase follows Apple's Liquid Glass design principles:
- **Native materials only** (`.ultraThinMaterial`)
- **Consistent corner radius** (20pt everywhere)
- **Subtle depth** (drop shadows, gradients)
- **Future-proof** (automatic updates with iOS visual system)
- **Performance first** (cached artwork, no flicker)

---

## ✅ Phase 76 Complete

**HomeView is now a premium, stable, liquid-glass dashboard with persistent Apple Music artwork and correct rainbow halo behavior.**
