## 🔑 Why This Will Include MusicKit Entitlements

**The entitlements are already added to your .entitlements file:**

```xml
<key>com.apple.developer.music-user-token</key>
<true/>
<key>com.apple.developer.music.subscription-service</key>
<true/>
```

**But the provisioning profile needs to:**
1. Be generated AFTER MusicKit was enabled on App ID
2. Include all the entitlements from the .entitlements file

---

## 🎯 What Happens After Creating

1. **Apple checks:** "Does this App ID have MusicKit enabled?"
2. **Answer:** YES (you enabled it earlier)
3. **Apple includes:** MusicKit entitlements in the profile
4. **Download profile:** Click "Download" button
5. **Install:** Double-click the `.mobileprovision` file
6. **In Xcode:** Should automatically use new profile

## 🎉 After Installing

In Xcode:
- Go to **Signing & Capabilities**
- Should see: **"Provisioning Profile: branchr Development Profile 2025"**
- Should NOT see: "Missing music-user-token" error ✅
