# 🎵 MusicKit Setup Guide - You Have Developer Account!

## ✅ What Just Changed

Your app now uses a **hybrid approach**:
1. **Tries catalog search first** (search entire Apple Music catalog)
2. **Falls back to library** (plays songs you've added to your library)

---

## 🚀 Current Status

### **✅ Works RIGHT NOW:**
- Library playback (songs in your Apple Music library)
- All playback controls
- Skip, pause, resume, artwork
