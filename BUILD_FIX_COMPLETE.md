# ✅ Build Fix Complete

**Issue:** Build was failing with redeclaration errors

## Problem Identified:
- Duplicate `HomeView_NEW.swift` file still in Views/Home/
- Xcode was compiling both the new and a leftover file
- Caused "invalid redeclaration" errors

## Solution Applied:
1. Deleted `Views/Home/HomeView_NEW.swift`
2. Ran `xcodebuild clean`
3. Rebuilt project

## Result:
- ✅ **BUILD SUCCEEDED**
- ✅ **0 warnings**
- ✅ **0 errors**

## Files in Views/Home/:
- `HomeView.swift` (new professional design)
- `ModeStatusBannerView.swift`

**Build is now clean and ready to run!** ✅
