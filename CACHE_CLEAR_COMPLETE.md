## 🎯 What This Means

### **Before:**
- Old provisioning profiles potentially cached
- Stale DerivedData causing build issues
- Archived builds taking up space
- Device support data from old iOS versions

### **After:**
- ✅ Clean slate for provisioning profiles
- ✅ Fresh build cache
- ✅ No archived builds
- ✅ Clean device support data
- ✅ Xcode will download everything fresh

## 🚀 Next Steps

### **When You Build Next:**
1. Xcode will create new `DerivedData` folder
2. Fresh provisioning profiles will be downloaded
3. Device support will be re-synced
4. Build cache will be rebuilt

### **For Device Builds:**
1. Connect your iPhone
2. Open Xcode
3. Select your device
4. Press Cmd + R
5. Xcode will download the correct provisioning profile

### **What Will Happen:**
- First build will take longer (cache rebuilding)
- Provisioning profiles will be fresh from Apple's servers
- No stale signing data
- Clean development environment

## ✅ Summary

**All Xcode caches cleared!**

**Cleared:**
