# 🎯 Enable MusicKit for Device Builds - COMPLETE GUIDE

## 🚨 The Problem

Your **entitlements file is perfect**, but the **provisioning profile** doesn't include MusicKit because Apple's servers don't know you need it yet.

---

## ✅ Solution: Enable MusicKit in Apple Developer Portal (5 minutes)

### **Step 1: Open Apple Developer Portal**

Go to this URL in your browser:

**https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list/bundleId**

Login with your Apple Developer account.

---

### **Step 2: Find Your App ID**

1. Search for: `com.joedormond.branchr`
2. Click on it to edit

---

### **Step 3: Enable MusicKit Capability**

1. Scroll down to the **"Capabilities"** section
2. Look for the checkbox: **☑️ MusicKit**
3. **Check the MusicKit checkbox**
4. Click **"Continue"**
5. Click **"Save"** (blue button)

---

### **Step 4: Wait for Apple to Sync**

⏰ **Wait 5-10 minutes** for Apple to:
- Enable MusicKit on your App ID
- Update your provisioning profiles
- Sync the changes to Xcode

You'll get an email when it's done (sometimes).

---

### **Step 5: Back in Xcode**

1. **Open Xcode**
2. Click **"Try Again"** button in the signing error
3. Xcode will download the new provisioning profile
4. Should see: ✅ **"Signing Certificate: Apple Development"**
5. Press **Cmd + B** to build

## 🎯 Alternative: Try "Automatically Manage Signing"

If "Try Again" doesn't work:

### **In Xcode:**
1. Select your project in left sidebar
2. Select **"branchr"** target
3. Go to **"Signing & Capabilities"** tab
4. Check the box: **☑️ "Automatically manage signing"**
5. Choose your team: `Team: 69Y49KN8KD (Me)`
6. Xcode will regenerate the profile
