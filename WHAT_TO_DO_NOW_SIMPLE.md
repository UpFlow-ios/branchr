# ✅ What to Do Now (30 seconds)

## DON'T Create a New Key

Your key (Key ID: `8C9DJ36V5V`) is **perfect** and already created!

---

## DO THIS INSTEAD

### **Step 1: Open This Link**

**https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list/bundleId**

*(App IDs - NOT Keys!)*

---

### **Step 2: Find Your App**

1. Search: `com.joedormond.branchr`
2. Click on it

---

### **Step 3: Enable MusicKit**

Scroll down to **"Capabilities"**

Check these boxes:
- ☑️ **Sign in with Apple**
- ☑️ **MusicKit**

Click **"Save"** (bottom right)

---

### **Step 4: Wait 10 Minutes**

Then go back to Xcode → Click **"Try Again"**

---

## 🎯 That's It!

You created the **key** (done ✅)  
Now you need to enable the **capability** (what you're doing now ✅)

These are two different things!

---

## 📱 After It Works

Press **Cmd + R** in Xcode → App runs on your phone! 🎵
