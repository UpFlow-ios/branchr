## 🚀 Quick Test (3 Options)

### **Option 1: Simulator + Add Songs (2 minutes)**

1. **Open Music app on simulator:**
   - Press `Cmd + Shift + H` (home)
   - Open **Music** app
   - If not signed in: Sign in with Apple ID

2. **Add songs to library:**
   - Search for "Calvin Harris"
   - Tap **"+"** next to songs
   - Add 3-5 different songs

3. **Test in Branchr:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/joedormond/Documents/branchr
   xcodebuild -project branchr.xcodeproj -scheme branchr \
     -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Pro' build
   ```
   - Run app in Xcode
   - Open DJ Controls
   - Tap Play button
   - **Should see:** `"✅ Found in library: [Song Name]"`

---

### **Option 2: Real iPhone (Recommended! ⭐)**

1. **Connect your iPhone via USB**

2. **Build for device:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/joedormond/Documents/branchr
   xcodebuild -project branchr.xcodeproj -scheme branchr \
     -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' \
     -allowProvisioningUpdates build
   ```

3. **Install & Test:**
   - Open Xcode
   - Select your iPhone as destination
   - Press `Cmd + R` to run
   - Your real library songs will work immediately!

**Why real device is better:**
- ✅ Full Apple Music integration
- ✅ Your existing library works instantly
- ✅ No simulator limitations
- ✅ Better performance testing

### **Option 3: Mac Music App Sync**

1. **Open Music app on your Mac**

2. **Add songs to library:**
   - Search and add songs
   - Make sure you're signed in with same Apple ID

3. **Wait for sync:**
   - iCloud syncs library across devices
   - Usually takes 1-2 minutes

4. **Test in simulator:**
   - Songs should now appear in simulator
   - Run Branchr and try DJ Controls

---

## 📊 What You'll See When It Works

### **Simulator Console:**
```
🔍 Step 1: Attempting catalog search for Calvin Harris...
⚠️ Catalog search failed: Failed to request developer token
💡 TIP: Register MusicKit identifier at developer.apple.com
🔄 Falling back to library playback...
📚 Step 2: Loading songs from your Apple Music library...
✅ Found in library: Summer by Calvin Harris
🎶 Now playing from LIBRARY: Summer
```

### **In DJ Controls UI:**
- Album artwork appears
- Song title shows: "Summer"
- Artist shows: "Calvin Harris"
- Play button becomes pause button
- 🎵 Music plays!

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **"No songs in library" (Your Current Issue)**

**Fix:**
1. Open Music app on simulator/device
2. Make sure you're signed in (Settings → Music)
3. Add songs to library (+ button)
4. Verify songs appear in Music app → Library tab
5. Try Branchr DJ Controls again

---

### **"Client is not entitled to access account store"**

**This is NORMAL in simulator!**
- Simulator has limited account access
- Library playback still works after adding songs
- For full functionality, use real device

---

### **Songs Added But Still "No songs in library"**

**Try:**
1. Force quit Branchr app
2. Force quit Music app
3. Wait 30 seconds for sync
4. Reopen Branchr
5. Try DJ Controls again

**Or:**
```bash
# Clean rebuild
cd /Users/joedormond/Documents/branchr
xcodebuild -project branchr.xcodeproj -scheme branchr clean
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/*
xcodebuild -project branchr.xcodeproj -scheme branchr \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Pro' build
```
